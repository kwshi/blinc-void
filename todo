how does printer setup work:

- need to install avahi & enable avahi-daemon service for auto-discovery of
  network printers

- follow these links to resolve `.local` hostname resolution (otherwise printing
  gives "unable to locate printer"):
  - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Avahi#Hostname_resolution
  - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS/Troubleshooting#Unable_to_locate_printer
  - https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/CUPS#Network

- miscellaneous printer drivers found in gutenprint, hplip, foomatic, etc.
